|`data_create.ipynb` | creates a data frame for analysis  |
|`data_explore.ipynb`| generates some simple statistics and manipulates data frame created from `data_create.ipynb`|
|`analysis.R`|runs machine learning algorithms to predict multi-label query categorization|

To run the analysis, ensure that the `analysis.R` script is in the same directory as the `data` directory, otherwise you will have to adjust the paths within the script in order to pull from the data.
